## Why you should choose Smart Group Guardian

This bot **drastically** reduces the number of bots required to manage a group, regardless of its size (one or one hundred members, it's only up to you!).

## Core values and core features

SmartGroupGuardian is an **open-source** Telegram bot for managing Telegram groups.

### Our values

We trust in the power of open-source software, so we all agreed to make this choice. Anybody has the right to contribute to the project under any of the aspects of the project, from code to documentation to new ideas and features.

### Bot features

Beside the common features (e.g. ban, warn...), this bot provides quite new features, such as the ```macro``` command and the measures adopted to enforce new group members to read the group rules.

The full features list is available [here](docs/features.md).
